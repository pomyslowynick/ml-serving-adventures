## ML Serving From Scratch

Trying to implement from scratch the ML serving stack by someone who has no idea what they are doing with help from Claude.

Current plan is to:
1. Create a naive server serving predictions for pretrained ResNet model from https://huggingface.co/microsoft/resnet-50 
2. Implement prediction batching
3. Adding support for different model formats and runtimes
4. Implement a client using KServe V2 protocol directly
